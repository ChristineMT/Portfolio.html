        <p>Learn more about me here.
            Coding/Programming has been one of the many things with which I've had a love-hate relationship. It is only natural that like many other aspects of my life, it too has suffered from my inconsistency. Not this year though! Huu mwaka huu, ndio mwaka wa kufosii song runs through my mind as I type this.
            That song will be my mantra and I welcome you to come along with me through this journey.
